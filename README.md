# Particle Simulator in a Enclosed Space

Module: Graphics for Games and Dynamics Modelling

Brief: Simulate, realisticly, a natural phenomena

Language: Processing 3

Grade: 1st

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did: 

Simulated Gas Particle Physics within a Cube.

Provided ability to change values of the Particles, size/temperature. As well as size of cube

Also included "experimental mode" where the limits that keep the app working smoothly were disabled, allowing for more instable but more interesting tests.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I would like to add post-marking

More realistic values, and interactions

More container shapes

rebuild whole application, to not use provided libraries, so that I can tailer project more to what I want it to do.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To-Do Bug Fixes:

Particles losing colour when more than normal amount are displayed.

Bring particles in with box when shrinking, to ensure they stay within bounds at all times.
